# springMVCHibernateDemo

It is a project that allows managing employees and items
and assigning items to employees  

This simple demo uses:
- spring + hibernate for model layer
- springMVC + jsp for presentation layer

It was forked from my private github account, where I use
my nickname (jenczuen).
